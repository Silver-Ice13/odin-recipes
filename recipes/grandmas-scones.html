        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>These scones are what grandma use to make. I have fond memories of helping grandma in the kitchen, where I had to grab a chair to see over the sink. Sometimes we would much them up and they would come out burnt or flat, but always fun times cooking.</p>

        <p>These scone are dense and have a cakie texture. They are great with just butter or add you favorite jam and cream. You can also add dried fruit to the mix for a little difference, we would ofter add dates to them</p>

        <h4>Ingredient</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of Plain Flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon of baking powder</li>
            <li>150g of Butter. Soften, but not liquid</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of Milk</li>
            <li>optional: half cup of dry fruit</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre-heat oven to 220c</li>
            <li>In a large mixing blow, mix: flour, sugar, baking powder.</li>
            <li>Add the butter and mix until the texture crumbles through fingers</li>
            <p><em>optional: Add the dry fruit after mixing butter through dry mix</em></p>
            <li>Create a well in the mix, crack the egg and add the milk. Combine until mixed to a dough</li>
            <li>To prevent sticking. Sprinkle flour on the bench or tray and add the dough on top. Sprinkle some extra flour around the dough.</li>
            <li>Flatten to about 2.5 cm thickness making a rough square. Roughly cut into 16 pieces. Dust the knife in flour to reduce the dough sticking</li>
            <li>Add pieces to baking tray, allowing them to touch sides of each other. This helps the scones rise</li>
            <li>Turn Oven down to 160c fan force (180c conventional). Cook for 25mins, or until golden brown on top</li>
            <li>Allow to cool on cake rack, then serve with condiments of your choice</li>
        </ol>
