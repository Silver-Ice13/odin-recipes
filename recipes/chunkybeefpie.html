        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>This is a very basic recipe on creating a chunky beef pie. The ingredients that you add to the slow cooker will be for any gravy, sauce or flavor that you like. Some examples: beef stock, bolognese sauce or curry paste. The main objective is to make the sauce thick rather than a liquid. You could also change type of protein you are using.</p>

        <h4>Ingredient</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>500g of beef gravy cut (or any cut of meat).</li>
            <li>Sauce of your choosing.</li>
            <li>Pre made short bread pastry sheets.</li>
            <li>Pre made puff pastry sheets.</li>
            <li>Salt, pepper and herbs to ones liking.</li>
            <li>Cooking oil (I prefer sunflower oil, but any non stick oil should do).</li>
            <li>Optional: corn flour for thickening as needed.</li>
            <li>Optional: 1 cup of veggies (I like to add a cup of pre soaked mixed beans).</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <h5>Cooking the meat filling</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Dice the beef into 3cm chunks.</li>
            <li>Add oil salt, pepper and herbs to slow cooker. And bring to heat.</li>
            <li>Add the meat to sear, stirring gently.</li>
            <li>Add the sauce to the meat, then slow cook for 4 hours (or as per your cookers instruction).</li>
            <li>Add the cornflour if needed and cook on a low heat until sauce has thickened.</li>
            <p>Once cooked and the sauce is thick, add veggies stir though and set to the side.</p>
        </ol>

        <h5>Cooking the pie</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre-heat oven to 180c.</li>
            <li>Grease a medium round baking dish.</li>
            <li>Cover the base of the dish with the short bread pastry, leaving extra over the side.</li>
            <li>Add the meat filling to the dish, carefully flattening to the sides.</li>
            <li>Cover the top with the puff pastry. Then working around the side of the dish, pinch and twist the two pastries together to seal the pie.</li>
            <li>poke two wholes in the centre of the puff pastry.</li>
            <p><em>optional: if you have left over bits of pastry, you can make decoration like leaves and place them on top of the pie</em></p>
            <li>Place in the overn and cook for 1 hour, or until pastry is golden brown</li>
            <p>Once cooked, set to the side to cool a little before serving</p>
        </ol>
